## Project Setup and Start Guide

This guide explains how to install dependencies and start both the server and the client of the project.

### I. Installation and start the server side:

1. Install dependencies for the REST-API server:

    Open Terminal, navigate and install:
    - cd REST-API
    - npm install

3. Start the REST-API server:
    - npm run dev

If everything is normal you will see the following messages:

    Connected to the database!
    Server is listening on http://localhost:3000
    

### II. Installation and start the client side:

1. Install dependencies for the client (SPA):

    Open Terminal, navigate and install:

        - cd project-app
        - npm install

3. Start the Application:
    - ng serve

The SPA will typically be available at http://localhost:4200.

Ensure the REST API server is running before starting the SPA to enable proper integration.
